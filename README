# Building

`mvn clean install -DskipTests`

# Testing locally

`mvn verify`

# Running

`java -jar target\treasure-hunt-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar "src/test/resources/simple-example.txt"`

N.B. The output is produced in the same directory as the input

# Further improvements

- Use of Dependency Injection to make tests more 'unital' ==> mock sub services
- add the possibility to configure the output folder
- try a Property-based testing approach ==> Need a more structured model
